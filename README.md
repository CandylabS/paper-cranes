## Introduction
An experiment of translating moving graphics into musical ideas.
## Background
<p>Evoking the feeling of a broad, open space has been a device used by contemporary classical composers and ambient producers.</p>
<p>Music, visual, and textual elements operate throughout eleven “scenes,” presented in a slideshow-like format in which a phrase of text is paired with an image and loop of music. Users advance through these slides at their own pace; they may also freely jump between slides out of order. </p>
<p>My intention has been to create music that draws the listener into the world of the artwork—music that "gives the listener a new lens through which to see art".</p>
## Method
The goal of this project is to find musical equivalents to color, texture, line, shape, etc., and fit them with each other in a landscape music context.
* <b>Visual Expression</b>:
</br>With this example I focused highly on the calculation of the fish geometry which is realised mostly with vector math and the trigonometric functions. [three.js canvas - geometry - birds](https://threejs.org/examples/canvas_geometry_birds.html) 
</br>The movement itself has 3 options: 
</br>-- Movement mode 1 = All fish try to reach the center
</br>-- Movement mode 2 = All fish align along a noise field
</br>-- Movement mode 3 = All fish align along a radial vector field

* <b>Sound Production</b>:
</br>Different sections or elements of the music are envisioned as responses to different areas within the image. In my “micro” film scoring technique, advancing each slide seamlessly triggers a change to the music loop—a shift in texture, instrumentation, rhythm, melody, or harmony.
* <b>User Control</b>:
